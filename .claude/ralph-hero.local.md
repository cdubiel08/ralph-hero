# Ralph GitHub Configuration

## Project Settings

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Owner | cdubiel08 |
| Repository | ralph-hero |
| Project Number | 3 |
| Project URL | https://github.com/users/cdubiel08/projects/3 |

## Environment Variables

Add to `.claude/settings.local.json` (recommended — Claude Code native, gitignored):

```json
{
  "env": {
    "RALPH_HERO_GITHUB_TOKEN": "ghp_your_token_here",
    "RALPH_GH_OWNER": "cdubiel08",
    "RALPH_GH_REPO": "ralph-hero",
    "RALPH_GH_PROJECT_NUMBER": "3"
  }
}
```

Or set in shell profile (must be before any interactive guard):

```bash
export RALPH_HERO_GITHUB_TOKEN="ghp_your_token_here"
export RALPH_GH_OWNER="cdubiel08"
export RALPH_GH_REPO="ralph-hero"
export RALPH_GH_PROJECT_NUMBER="3"
```

**Important**: Do NOT put tokens in `.mcp.json` — the env block can mask inherited values.
