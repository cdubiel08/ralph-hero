# Plan Critique: GH-387 - Create demo seed script for onboarding showcase

## Verdict: APPROVED

The plan is well-structured, complete, and ready for implementation.

## Analysis

### Completeness
- **Single phase clearly defined**: The plan specifies exactly one new file (`plugin/ralph-hero/scripts/demo-seed.sh`) with 10 numbered implementation sections.
- **All acceptance criteria addressed**: Each criterion from the issue (umbrella + sub-issues, parent/child linking, project board addition, stdout output, idempotency) has a corresponding implementation section.
- **Success criteria are specific and testable**: Includes both automated checks (`bash -n`, `shellcheck`) and manual verification steps.

### Feasibility
- **Referenced files verified**: All referenced files exist on disk:
  - `plugin/ralph-hero/scripts/ralph-loop.sh` (convention reference)
  - `plugin/ralph-hero/scripts/ralph-cli.sh` (convention reference)
  - `plugin/ralph-hero/mcp-server/src/tools/relationship-tools.ts` (GraphQL mutation reference)
  - `thoughts/shared/research/2026-02-24-GH-0387-demo-seed-script.md` (research document)
- **GraphQL mutation is correct**: The `addSubIssue` mutation in the plan matches the implementation in `relationship-tools.ts` (uses `issueId` and `subIssueId` input fields).
- **`gh` CLI commands are valid**: `gh issue create`, `gh api graphql`, `gh project item-add`, and `gh label` commands use correct syntax.
- **Convention alignment verified**: The plan correctly identifies `set -euo pipefail`, `#!/usr/bin/env bash`, manual argument parsing, and environment variable defaults as existing conventions (confirmed from `ralph-loop.sh`).

### Clarity
- **"What We're NOT Doing" is well-defined**: Explicitly excludes cleanup script (#388), recording (#389), documentation (#390), project field value setting, state file writing, and MCP server changes.
- **Idempotency strategy is clear**: Uses `ralph-demo` label presence check with `--force` override.
- **Output format is specified**: Machine-readable last line (space-separated numbers) plus human-readable summary above it.

### Scope
- **Appropriately sized for XS estimate**: Single new shell script, no modifications to existing files, no test files needed.
- **No scope creep**: Does not attempt to set workflow states, priorities, or estimates on demo issues (correctly deferred to the showcase itself).

## Minor Observations (non-blocking)
1. The plan shows `\n` in the `--body` argument to `gh issue create` (section 6). In practice, `gh issue create --body` handles literal newlines, but `\n` may need to be `$'\n'` or use `printf`. The implementer should verify this during implementation -- it's a trivial fix.
2. The `--silent` flag on `gh api graphql` (section 8) is not a standard `gh` flag. The correct flag is `--silent` for `gh api` but the implementer should verify. Again, trivial to fix during implementation.

These are implementation-time details, not plan-level issues. The plan's logic and structure are sound.

## Conclusion

The plan is complete, feasible, well-scoped, and follows established project conventions. No iteration needed.
