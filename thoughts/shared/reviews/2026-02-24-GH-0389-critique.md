# Plan Critique: GH-389 - Record Annotated Showcase Demo

## Verdict: APPROVED

## Completeness

The plan is well-structured with a single phase containing 6 clear steps: environment setup, dry run, recording, post-production, upload/hosting, and cleanup. Each step has concrete shell commands and expected outcomes. The plan correctly identifies this as a human-operator task requiring no new code.

All phases are defined with clear, actionable instructions. The dry-run step (Step 2) is a particularly good addition for calibrating recording duration before the actual capture.

## Feasibility

All referenced files verified to exist on disk:
- `plugin/ralph-hero/scripts/demo-seed.sh` -- exists
- `plugin/ralph-hero/scripts/demo-cleanup.sh` -- exists
- `plugin/ralph-hero/skills/record-demo/SKILL.md` -- exists
- `plugin/ralph-hero/scripts/ralph-team-loop.sh` -- exists
- `plugin/ralph-hero/.gitignore` -- exists, confirms `recordings/` is excluded
- `thoughts/shared/research/2026-02-24-GH-0389-record-annotated-showcase-demo.md` -- exists

The prerequisite issues (GH-387 and GH-388) are both in Done/Closed state, confirming infrastructure readiness. The group context shows issues 387 and 388 are CLOSED.

## Clarity

Success criteria are specific and testable (all marked as "Manual" verification, which is appropriate for a recording task). The chapter marker template provides concrete timestamps as a starting point, with clear instruction to adjust to actual recording.

The "What We're NOT Doing" section is well-defined, explicitly scoping out Options B and C from the idea doc and deferring README/wiki updates to sibling issue #390.

## Scope

The plan is appropriately sized for a Small estimate. It is a single operator-executed session with no code changes. The two-artifact approach (asciinema + OBS MP4) provides good coverage without over-engineering.

## Minor Notes (Non-Blocking)

- The plan references `obs-cli` for recording control, which requires Go installation. The `record-demo` skill is offered as an alternative, which is a reasonable fallback.
- Chapter marker timestamps (0:00 through 9:00) are example values only; the plan correctly instructs the operator to adjust to actual recording.

## Conclusion

The plan is complete, feasible, and well-scoped. All referenced infrastructure exists. Success criteria are testable. No issues identified that would block implementation.
