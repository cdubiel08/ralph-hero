# Plan Critique: Research Skill Missing Agents (#60)

## Overall Assessment: APPROVED

This is a straightforward, well-scoped plan to copy 5 research-support agent definitions from the workspace into the plugin. The root cause analysis is correct (agents exist at workspace level but not in plugin), the fix is appropriate (make plugin self-contained), and the scope is minimal.

## Completeness

Single phase covering all 5 agents with specific source/destination paths, frontmatter specifications, and required adaptations. The "What We're NOT Doing" section correctly excludes: SKILL.md changes, `thoughts-analyzer` (not referenced), workspace agent modifications, and plugin manifest updates.

## Technical Feasibility

### Verified Claims

1. **Plugin ships 4 worker agents**: Confirmed. `plugin/ralph-hero/agents/` contains exactly: `ralph-analyst.md`, `ralph-builder.md`, `ralph-validator.md`, `ralph-integrator.md`.

2. **Source agents exist at workspace level**: Confirmed. All 5 agents found in `~/projects/landcrawler-worktrees/LAN-34/.claude/agents/` (and other worktrees):
   - `codebase-locator.md` -- has `tools: Grep, Glob, LS` (LS needs replacement)
   - `codebase-analyzer.md` -- has `tools: Read, Grep, Glob, LS` (LS needs replacement)
   - `codebase-pattern-finder.md` -- exists (verified via glob)
   - `thoughts-locator.md` -- exists (verified via glob)
   - `web-search-researcher.md` -- has `tools: WebSearch, WebFetch, TodoWrite, Read, Grep, Glob, LS` and `color: yellow` (TodoWrite, LS, color need removal/replacement)

3. **Agent names match SKILL.md references**: Confirmed. `ralph-research/SKILL.md:75-79` references all 5 agents by exact name: `codebase-locator`, `codebase-analyzer`, `codebase-pattern-finder`, `thoughts-locator`, `web-search-researcher`.

4. **Frontmatter adaptations are correct**:
   - `LS` -> `Bash`: Correct. `LS` is a workspace tool that may not be available in plugin contexts.
   - `TodoWrite` removal from web-search-researcher: Correct. Not relevant for sub-agent research tasks.
   - `color: yellow` removal: Correct. Sub-agents don't need color.

5. **SKILL.md references in other skills**: Confirmed at the documented lines:
   - `ralph-plan/SKILL.md:125-126` -- `codebase-pattern-finder`, `codebase-analyzer`
   - `ralph-triage/SKILL.md:100` -- `codebase-locator`
   - `ralph-split/SKILL.md:49` -- `codebase-locator`, `codebase-analyzer`
   - `ralph-review/SKILL.md:193-194` -- `codebase-analyzer`

### Note on Source Path

The plan references `~/projects/.claude/agents/` as the workspace-level source. In practice, these agents are at `~/projects/landcrawler-worktrees/LAN-*/. claude/agents/` (per-worktree copies). The implementer should use any available copy -- the content is identical across worktrees. This is a minor path clarification, not blocking.

## Clarity of Success Criteria

Automated verification is specific and testable:
- File count check (9 total agents)
- Name grep in each new file
- Negative grep for `LS` and `TodoWrite`

Manual verification covers frontmatter validity, no workspace paths, and portability.

## Scope Assessment

Appropriately tight for an S estimate: 5 markdown files copied with minor frontmatter edits. No code changes, no tests, no SKILL.md modifications.

## Verdict

**APPROVED** -- Simple, well-documented copy operation with clear adaptations. All source files verified, all target references confirmed. Proceed to implementation.
