# Plan Critique: GH-365 Centralize Quality Standards

## Verdict: APPROVED

The plan is well-structured, correctly scoped, and ready for implementation.

## Completeness

All changes are fully specified. The plan defines exactly 4 file operations (1 CREATE, 3 MODIFY) with complete before/after content for each modification. The new `quality-standards.md` file content is provided in full (~50 lines). Each skill file replacement shows the exact text to remove and the exact text to insert. No ambiguity remains about what to change.

The plan correctly includes a File Ownership Summary table and an Integration Testing section covering relative link validation and the AUTO mode inline prompt preservation check.

## Feasibility

All referenced files verified:

- `plugin/ralph-hero/skills/ralph-plan/SKILL.md` -- exists, lines 285-300 match the "Planning Quality Guidelines" section exactly as quoted in the plan.
- `plugin/ralph-hero/skills/ralph-review/SKILL.md` -- exists, lines 397-409 match the "Quality Guidelines" section exactly as quoted in the plan.
- `plugin/ralph-hero/skills/ralph-research/SKILL.md` -- exists, lines 222-226 match the "Research Quality" section exactly as quoted in the plan.
- `plugin/ralph-hero/skills/shared/` -- directory exists with `conventions.md`, confirming the `quality-standards.md` file location is valid and follows the established pattern.

Relative links (`../shared/quality-standards.md`) are correct given the directory structure: each skill lives in `skills/ralph-*/` and the shared directory is at `skills/shared/`.

## Clarity

Success criteria are specific and testable:

- 5 automated checks using `test -f` and `grep` commands -- all will produce deterministic pass/fail results.
- 2 manual verification items (AUTO mode prompt unchanged, no other skill files modified) -- both are concrete and easy to verify.

The research document's 4-dimension framework (Completeness, Feasibility, Clarity, Scope) is already validated by 26 existing critique documents in the reviews directory.

## Scope

The "What We're NOT Doing" section is explicit and well-bounded with 5 exclusions:

1. Not modifying the AUTO mode inline prompt (lines 196-200) -- correctly identified as a sub-agent constraint
2. Not modifying `ralph-impl/SKILL.md` -- correctly excluded since it consumes checkboxes mechanically
3. Not modifying `ralph-triage/SKILL.md` -- correctly excluded since confidence levels are triage-specific
4. Not modifying `shared/conventions.md` -- separation of concerns between quality and protocol
5. Not changing plan template structure -- preserving existing Success Criteria / What We're NOT Doing sections

All exclusions are well-reasoned and match the research findings.

## Risk Assessment

The single identified risk (breaking the AUTO mode critique prompt) is correctly mitigated by leaving lines 196-200 untouched. The plan explicitly targets only the Quality Guidelines section (lines 397-409), not the inline Task prompt.

Token cost impact (~50-100 tokens per invocation) is negligible as noted.

## Minor Observations (Non-Blocking)

1. The research document references lines 397-413 for the ralph-review Quality Guidelines section, while the plan uses 397-409. Both are defensible -- the plan's range is more precise since lines 410+ begin the Link Formatting section. No action needed.

2. The new `quality-standards.md` introduces "Research Quality Dimensions" with 4 named dimensions (Depth, Feasibility, Risk, Actionability) that are new vocabulary not previously validated in practice, unlike the plan dimensions which have 26 critiques backing them. This is acceptable for a first iteration since research quality was previously unstructured.
