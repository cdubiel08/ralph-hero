# Plan Critique: GH-453 Remove 5 Old Mutation Tools

## Verdict: APPROVED

This is a straightforward mechanical deletion plan. All claims verified.

## Verification Results

### Deletion targets confirmed
All 5 tool registrations exist at the expected locations:
- `ralph_hero__update_issue` — `issue-tools.ts:1242`
- `ralph_hero__update_workflow_state` — `issue-tools.ts:1352`
- `ralph_hero__update_estimate` — `issue-tools.ts:1452`
- `ralph_hero__update_priority` — `issue-tools.ts:1510`
- `ralph_hero__clear_field` — `project-management-tools.ts:374`

### Phase 1 prerequisite met
`ralph_hero__save_issue` exists at `issue-tools.ts:970`, confirming GH-452 is complete.

### Shared helpers are safe
`resolveConfig` and `resolveFullConfig` are used across 5 files (`issue-tools.ts`, `batch-tools.ts`, `project-management-tools.ts`, `relationship-tools.ts`, `sync-tools.ts`), so removing the 5 target tools will not orphan them.

## Minor Observations

1. **Line numbers are stale**: The plan references lines ~969-1290 for `issue-tools.ts` tools, but actual locations are ~1242-1570 (shifted by the `save_issue` addition in Phase 1). The plan already acknowledges this in Key Implementation Note #3 and instructs the builder to grep by tool name rather than line number. No action needed.

2. **Plan is well-structured**: Bottom-up deletion order, explicit preservation list for shared helpers, clear success criteria with both automated and manual checks.

## Conclusion

No blocking issues. The plan is complete, feasible, and ready for implementation.
