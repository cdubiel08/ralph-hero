# Plan Critique: GH-52 - Fix TaskUpdate Self-Notification

## Verdict: APPROVED

The plan is well-structured, correctly scoped, and ready for implementation.

## Completeness

- **Phases**: Both phases are clearly defined with specific file paths and exact text changes.
- **Success criteria**: Each phase has both automated (grep) and manual verification steps. The automated checks are concrete and testable.
- **What we're NOT doing**: Well-defined exclusions (not removing owner, not adding extra API calls, not modifying SDK). This prevents scope creep.

## Feasibility

All file references verified against the codebase:

| File | Exists | Step number correct | Content matches |
|------|--------|-------------------|-----------------|
| `agents/ralph-researcher.md` | Yes | Step 5, line 17 | Matches |
| `agents/ralph-planner.md` | Yes | Step 5, line 17 | Matches |
| `agents/ralph-advocate.md` | Yes | Step 5, line 17 | Matches |
| `agents/ralph-implementer.md` | Yes | Step 6, line 18 | Matches |
| `agents/ralph-triager.md` | Yes | Step 5, line 18 | Matches |
| `skills/shared/conventions.md` | Yes | After Pipeline Handoff Protocol (~L135) | Matches |

The plan correctly identifies that the implementer has a different step number (6 vs 5) due to the file ownership check at step 5.

## Clarity

- The SDK awareness note wording is consistent across all agents.
- The "continue immediately" language is clear and actionable.
- The conventions section documents root cause, impact, and mitigation separately -- good for future reference.

## Scope

Appropriate for an S-estimate bug fix. Changes are purely documentation/instruction additions with no structural changes to the task loop or tool calls. The plan correctly notes coordination needed with GH-53 (same files).

## Minor Observations (Not Blocking)

1. The plan notes that the triager's completion is "step 5 (line 18)" while the researcher's is "step 5 (line 17)". This is because the triager has an extra line for the conditional triage/split skill invocation. The plan handles this correctly.
2. The SDK Note section placement ("after the Shutdown section") is consistent and predictable. All agents currently end with a Shutdown section, so the new section will always be at the end.
3. The research thoroughly evaluated 6 approaches before recommending the chosen one. The trade-off analysis is sound.

## Conclusion

No blocking issues found. The plan is ready for implementation.
