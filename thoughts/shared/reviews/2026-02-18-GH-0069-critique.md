# Plan Critique: Move PR Creation from Team-Lead to Integrator (#69)

## Overall Assessment: APPROVED

This is a well-scoped, precisely targeted plan that moves PR creation responsibility from the team-lead to the integrator worker. All file references are verified, the phasing is logical, and the changes are purely markdown instruction files with no code impact.

## Completeness

All 4 phases are clearly defined with specific file-level, line-level changes:

- **Phase 1**: SKILL.md -- remove lead's PR creation role (5 discrete edits)
- **Phase 2**: ralph-integrator.md -- add PR creation capability (5 discrete edits)
- **Phase 3**: Builder + templates -- update handoff references (3 files, 4 edits)
- **Phase 4**: conventions.md -- pipeline handoff table (1 edit)

The "What We're NOT Doing" section is well-defined: no MCP tools, no serialization changes, no new skills, no task subject pattern changes.

## Technical Feasibility

### All File References Verified

1. **SKILL.md:35** -- Confirmed. "PR creation (after implementation completes)" is listed under "Your ONLY direct work" at line 35.
2. **SKILL.md:128** -- Confirmed. "PR task is always lead's direct work (not delegated to a teammate)." present at line 128.
3. **SKILL.md:147** -- Confirmed. Dispatch responsibility #4 about PR creation at line 147.
4. **SKILL.md:151-157** -- Confirmed. Section 4.5 "Lead Creates PR (Only Direct Work)" at lines 151-157.
5. **SKILL.md:188** -- Confirmed. Spawn table at line 188 shows only "Merge" or "Integrate" for integrator role.
6. **ralph-integrator.md:13** -- Confirmed. Task loop step 1 only matches "Merge" or "Integrate" at line 13.
7. **ralph-integrator.md:3** -- Confirmed. Description says "handles PR merge" (no creation).
8. **ralph-builder.md:22** -- Confirmed. Step 6 references "lead handles PR creation" at line 22.
9. **ralph-builder.md:30** -- Confirmed. "DO NOT push to remote for implementation -- lead handles PR creation" at line 30.
10. **implementer.md:7** -- Confirmed. "The lead handles pushing and PR creation" at line 7.
11. **integrator.md:1** -- Confirmed. Only mentions "Merge PR for #..." at line 1.
12. **conventions.md:101** -- Confirmed. Pipeline Handoff Protocol routes builder (impl done) to "Lead (PR creation)" / "team-lead" at line 101.

### Architecture Observations

The plan correctly identifies that:
- The integrator already has `Bash` tool access (line 4 of ralph-integrator.md frontmatter)
- The integrator already uses `gh pr view` and `gh pr merge`, so `gh pr create` is a natural extension
- The integrator is single-instance/serialized, which is correct for PR creation (one push at a time)
- The "Create PR for GH-NNN" task subject pattern already exists in SKILL.md

## Clarity of Success Criteria

Each phase has both automated (grep-based) and manual verification steps. The automated checks are specific and testable:
- Negative checks (old patterns gone): `grep -c "PR creation" SKILL.md` returns 0
- Positive checks (new patterns present): `grep "Create PR" ralph-integrator.md` matches

## Scope Assessment

The scope is appropriately tight for an S estimate:
- 6 markdown files, ~15 discrete text edits
- No TypeScript, no tests, no MCP server changes
- All changes are documentation/instruction refactoring
- Clear before/after examples for every edit

## Non-Blocking Notes

1. **Section renumbering**: Phase 1 Section 4 mentions renumbering 4.6 to 4.5 after removing Section 4.5. The plan should also verify any cross-references to "Section 4.6" elsewhere in SKILL.md don't break. Quick grep confirms "4.6" appears only at line 159 ("### 4.6 Shutdown and Cleanup"), so renumbering is clean.

2. **Lead's dispatch loop after PR removal**: With dispatch responsibility #4 removed, the remaining 3 responsibilities (exception handling, worker gaps, intake) should be renumbered. The plan mentions "Renumber if needed" which covers this.

3. **Integrator PR creation procedure completeness**: The plan's proposed PR creation procedure (Phase 2, Section 3) correctly includes: push, gh pr create, state transitions to "In Review", task completion update, and critical note about task description. This matches the current SKILL.md Section 4.5 content precisely.

## Verdict

**APPROVED** -- The plan is precise, all references verified, scope is tight, and the approach is sound. This is a clean refactoring of agent responsibilities with no architectural risk. Proceed to implementation.
