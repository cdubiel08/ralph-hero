## Key Metrics

- **6 PRs** merged to main
- **708 tests** passing at completion
- **~50% tool reduction** (53 → 26 tools)
- **2 merge conflicts** resolved (PR #461 needed rebase after parallel merges)
- **26 tasks** completed across 3 workers

## Notes

- Phases 1-4 ran with maximum parallelism: analyst planned #452/#454/#455 simultaneously, builder implemented #453/#454/#455 in parallel background agents
- PR #461 (#455) required manual conflict resolution after #453 and #454 merged first — expected outcome of parallel branch strategy
- TaskList visibility issue for analyst (team context mismatch) — worked around via direct messages with task details
- All plans derived from parent plan at `thoughts/shared/plans/2026-02-27-mcp-toolspace-consolidation.md`
