# Everything in this plugin is read-mostly by design: board reads + herdr
# orchestration + notifications. The board CLI is the ONLY board path — no
# gh project/graphql anywhere — and no script here writes board state; the
# claiming happens inside the spawned /ralph:work session, on the same
# sanctioned path a human typing the skill would take.

# Knobs:
#   RALPH_HERDR_REPO          repo to operate on (default: the pane's cwd —
#                             plugin actions open panes with --cwd <workspace cwd>)
#   RALPH_HERDR_BOARD         path to the board CLI (default: $REPO/ralph/scripts/board,
#                             the vendored-checkout layout). Host repos that install
#                             ralph as a Claude Code plugin have no ralph/ tree —
#                             point this at the installed plugin's scripts/board
#   HERDR_BIN_PATH            injected inside herdr panes; falls back to `herdr`
#                             on PATH for dev runs outside a pane
#   RALPH_ALLOW_API_BILLING   set to "true" to deliberately allow spawning with
#                             ANTHROPIC_API_KEY present (see billing_guard)
