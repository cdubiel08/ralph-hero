# A11y Scan — Accessibility Audit via CLI

## Prerequisites
- `playwright-cli` installed globally (see `/ralph-playwright:setup`)
- Target app running

## Process

### Step 1: Execute (freeform, a11y goal)

Generate session name: `<date>-a11y-scan-<slug>`

Spawn `explorer-agent` with:
- `url`: Target URL (from arguments or ask)
- `goal`: "Systematically audit this page for WCAG 2.2 AA accessibility compliance. Focus on: form labels, tab order, keyboard operability, color contrast ratios, ARIA attributes, heading hierarchy, alt text, and focus management."
- `session`: The generated session name

The agent navigates the page, interacts with all interactive elements (especially via keyboard), and captures snapshots at each state.

### Step 2: Reflect (a11y signals only)

Read the journey trace. For each step, examine the accessibility snapshot (`.md` file) for:

- **Missing or empty labels**: Form fields without associated `<label>` or `aria-label`
- **Broken tab order**: Elements not reachable via Tab, or illogical order
- **Keyboard inoperability**: Buttons/links not operable via Enter/Space
- **Missing ARIA**: Interactive components without `role`, `aria-expanded`, `aria-describedby` etc.
- **Heading hierarchy**: Skipped levels (h1 → h3), missing h1, multiple h1s
- **Color contrast**: Text against background ratios below 4.5:1 (normal) or 3:1 (large)
- **Missing alt text**: Images without `alt` attribute
- **Focus management**: Modals/dialogs that don't trap focus, focus not returned on close

Classify all findings as `a11y_violation` signals with WCAG success criteria references.

Write signal report to `.playwright-cli/<session>/signal-report.yaml`.

### Step 3: Act

For each signal:
1. **Critical/high**: Create GitHub issue with WCAG reference, element details, and remediation guidance
2. **Promote evidence screenshots** showing the violation context
3. **Write research note** to `thoughts/shared/research/<date>-<slug>-a11y-audit.md` with full findings

### Step 4: Report

```
== A11y Scan: http://localhost:3000/login ==
WCAG 2.2 AA | playwright-cli | N violations

🔴 CRITICAL (N):
  - <violation> → <remediation> (WCAG <criterion>)

🟠 HIGH (N):
  - <violation> → <remediation> (WCAG <criterion>)

🟡 MEDIUM (N):
  - <violation> → <remediation> (WCAG <criterion>)

Actions: N issues created, N screenshots promoted
```
